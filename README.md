For paleocurrent analysis there are two notebooks, one built to run on jupyter notebook and the other to run on google Colab. They perform the calculation of the mean and standard deviation, and plot results in a rose diagram.

Input files must contain paleocurrent azimuths, in the form of an excel file. The current version takes up to three paleocurrent datasets, listed in three diferent columns. The first row contains headings (paleocurrent type, such as flutes, grooves,...):

heading1   heading2   heading3

value1      value1    value1

value2      value2    value2

...         ...       ...
