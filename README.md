Paleocurrent analysis notebooks are in two versions, one built to run on jupyter notebook and the other to run on google Colab. Input files must contain paleocurrent azimuths, in the form of an excel file, with first row taken for headings. The current version takes up to three paleocurrent datasets, listed in three diferent columns:

heading1   heading2   heading3

value1      value1    value1

value2      value2    value2

...         ...       ...
